# NovaInsurance-Vannilla-Website
I was hired by an insurance agency to recreate and modernize their old wordpress site. This is the project that accomplishes just that.
This is the first website project I have ever worked on. You can check the final and working product here: http://zastrahovam.eu/

For this job there were a few requirements:
- Users must have an easy way to any product the firm offers.
- The pictures were to be fully licensed.
- The website was required to work on most types of screens/devices/browsers.
- The site needed a completely new design.
- On the contact page, users needed to have a free "Over internet call" feature.
- Each product order was proccessed trough a form that was to be sent to the company email.
- In the banners there should be a FB page link with a like button.
- All the pages for the products should follow a commong design language.
- In-page PDF viewer.
- Form Captcha protection.
- A "ThankYou" page with a timer.
... and many more...

To achieve the template/design freedom we needed, I decided to create the project using the vanilla tools like HTML/CSS/JS and build this site from the ground up.

Here are a few pictures of the final product:
